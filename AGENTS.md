# AGENTS.md

## The Two Most Important Things
- Purpose: This project is NOT about writing code. It is about researching and organizing some basic information about board games.
- `games.md`: This file is the report we're working on.

## Operation

You will be asked to research games, either from the list of not-yet-researched games or matching some other criteria. Use the web to gather the needed information and update `games.md` with your conclusions. Preferred resources have been provided, but *you are empowered to use the whole web* to find good information.

### Report Organization

Each researched game is its own level-two section (##) and a bullet list of properties. Put the property name in bold (**), followed by a colon and the information.

Properties: 

- **Solo Rules**: Either "Not Found", "Included", or a link to rules. When searching for links to rules, check the publisher first for official rules.
- **How to Play**: Link to a YouTube video, or "Not Found". Note that "playthrough" videos are different and not wanted.
- **User Notes**: Purely manually maintained. Do not add this property, and do not modify it if you encounter it.
- **Researched**: Date this game was researched, in M/D/YYYY format. When you are doing the research, set this to today's date.

After the researched games, there is a simple list of games which have not yet been researched. Do not change this list, except to alphabetize it.

### Examples

Kingdomino is a fully researched game for which there are unofficial solo rules, and to which the user has added a note:

```
## Kingdomino

**Solo Rules**: https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1741841/solo-kingdomino
**How to Play**: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smbwBPmP4Ms&t=175s
**User Notes**: Only ever played solo
**Researched**: 1/15/2025
```

Blumpskins is a hypothetical game which has been researched, but for which no information could be found:

```
## Blumperskins

**Solo Rules**: Not Found
**How to Play**: Not Found
**Researched**: 10/31/2025
```

### Guidance

- Keep the games alphabetized
- Never change "User Notes", which is purely manually maintained
- When researching, if you cannot find a good value for a property (other than User Notes), add the property and say it is "Not Found"
- Keep editorializing and meta-data in the report to a minimum; it is meant to be quite concise.
- Maintain property order
- Game expansions are not yet supported. Don't worry about them.
